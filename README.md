# NTFKit - Network Troubleshooting Field Kit
---
## Summary:
This project was started to extend the capability of a small internal group to support individuals with diverse backgrounds.  The initial focus was
to gather data (especially packet captures) for offline analysis and baselining.  The project is growing, but the development is slow.  The focus continues
to be on data acquisition, but some effort is being made to provide other options and capabilities.

## ToDo:
- Documentation
- make it more user-friendly
- dynamic vlan interface
- arpwatch patch to enable 802.1q
- bash auto complete for .todo extensions
- Snort ICS signatures
- fix wifite (low priority)
- work on better initialization script for new deployments (open to recommendations - gitlab perhaps?)
- documentation for creating and using a public key on windows computers (putty?)
- create install.sh script that takes a base raspian install and converts it to a NTFKit sensor (may be difficult because we use pwnie express image)
- Additional automated reports (see reports list)
- incorporate more tools:
  - https://github.com/sneakymonk3y/foxhound-nsm
  - Cyberlens sensor
  - Bro
    - Bro ICS signature
